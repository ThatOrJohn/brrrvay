# Brrrvay Admin App

Brrrvay is a vision-driven platform to help bar operators keep drinks flowing. It uses edge-based computer vision (CV) to detect empty mugs/glasses and provide real-time alerts to staff, while also collecting valuable operational insights.

This repo contains the **admin and customer dashboard** portion of Brrrvay, built with modern web technologies like Next.js and Drizzle ORM.

## âœ¨ Features

- Password-based authentication (SSO planned)
- Role-based access control
- Neon-hosted Postgres with Drizzle ORM
- Built-in foundation for Company > Concept > Store hierarchy
- Placeholder dashboard to expand on alerting and analytics
- Future integration with `brrrvay-agent` running on edge devices
